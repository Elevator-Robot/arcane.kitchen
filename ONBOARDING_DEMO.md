# 🧙‍♀️ Arcane Kitchen - Onboarding Flow Documentation ✨

## Overview

The Arcane Kitchen onboarding flow provides a mandatory, immersive RPG-style character creation experience for first-time visitors. This full-screen journey introduces users to the mystical world of culinary magic while collecting their preferences for personalization.

## Flow Structure

### 🌟 Step 1: Welcome & Introduction
**Component**: `WelcomeIntro.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Set the mystical tone and explain what Arcane Kitchen is
- **Content**: Narrative-driven introduction to Kitchen Witches and culinary magic
- **Actions**: 
  - "Begin Your Journey" button to start character creation
  - "Return to Your Coven" sign-in option for existing users
- **Theming**: Full mystical atmosphere with floating orbs and mystical quotes

### 🎭 Step 2: Avatar Selection
**Component**: `AvatarSelection.tsx`
- **Header**: "Who are you?" (as required by acceptance criteria)
- **Purpose**: Let users choose their kitchen witch persona
- **Integration**: Uses existing `ProfilePictureSelector` component
- **Validation**: Users cannot proceed without selecting an avatar
- **Feedback**: Success message when avatar is selected

### 📝 Step 3: Name Entry
**Component**: `NameEntry.tsx`
- **Header**: "What is your name?" (as required by acceptance criteria)
- **Purpose**: Collect user's chosen magical identity
- **Features**:
  - Real-time character count (50 max)
  - Live preview of greeting
  - Dramatic submission animation
- **Validation**: Minimum 2 characters required

### 🎓 Step 4: Feature Tutorial
**Component**: `FeatureTutorial.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Introduce key Arcane Kitchen features
- **Content**: 
  - 🧙‍♀️ Mystical Sous Chef (AI cooking assistant)
  - 📜 Recipe Discovery (browse by magical properties)
  - 📖 Personal Grimoire (custom cookbook)
  - ⚗️ Alchemical Transformations (recipe modifications)
- **Navigation**: Step-by-step walkthrough with progress indicators

## State Management

### `useOnboarding` Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts`

```typescript
interface OnboardingData {
  avatar: string;
  name: string;
  cookingStyle?: string;
  favoriteIngredients?: string[];
  magicalSpecialty?: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Session Storage**: Trial mode data persists in browser session
- **Cognito Integration**: Authenticated users save data to AWS user attributes
- **Reset Functionality**: Clean slate for testing/development

### Session vs. Authenticated Storage

**Trial Mode (Session Storage)**:
- Data stored in `sessionStorage` with key `arcane_onboarding_data`
- Persists until browser session ends
- Used for unauthenticated exploration

**Authenticated Mode (Cognito)**:
- Saves to user attributes: `given_name`, `picture`, `custom:cooking_style`, etc.
- Permanent storage linked to user account
- Seamless transition from trial to full account

## App Integration

### `App.tsx` Changes
The main app now checks onboarding status before rendering the normal interface:

```typescript
const shouldShowOnboarding = !authLoading && isOnboardingRequired;

if (shouldShowOnboarding) {
  return (
    <OnboardingFlow
      isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}
      onComplete={() => completeOnboarding(isAuthenticated)}
      onSignIn={handleAuthChange}
    />
  );
}
```

## Theming & Animations

### Mystical Design Elements
- **Colors**: Emerald, amber, and stone tones with magical gradients
- **Animations**: `animate-mystical-float` for floating particles
- **Typography**: Cinzel for headers, Merriweather for body text
- **Effects**: Glowing orbs, mystical particles, gradient text

### CSS Additions
- Added `@keyframes mystical-float` animation
- Consistent `cottage-interior` background throughout
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
