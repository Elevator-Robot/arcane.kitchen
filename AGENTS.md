# AI Agents and Integrations

This document describes all AI agents, bots, and automated systems that interact with the Arcane Kitchen codebase and user experience.

## Overview

Arcane Kitchen leverages AI technology to enhance the cooking experience while maintaining the illusion of "mystical" assistance rather than obvious artificial intelligence. All AI integrations are designed to be invisible to end users, appearing as natural parts of the magical cooking experience.

## Active AI Agents

### 1. Mystical Sous Chef Assistant

**Role**: Primary conversational AI for cooking assistance and recipe guidance

**Technology**: Amazon Nova Pro (AWS Bedrock)

**Integration Points**:

- **Frontend**: `/src/components/SousChef.tsx`, `/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
- **Backend**: `/amplify/data/resource.ts` (conversation model definition)
- **Hook**: `/src/hooks/useMessages.ts` (conversation management)

**Capabilities**:

- Recipe suggestions and modifications
- Cooking technique guidance
- Ingredient substitution recommendations
- Dietary accommodation assistance
- General cooking Q&A

**System Prompt**:

```
You are a helpful cooking assistant for Arcane Kitchen.
You help users with recipes, cooking techniques, and ingredient questions.

Keep your responses practical and friendly. Focus on:
- Recipe suggestions and modifications
- Cooking techniques and tips
- Ingredient substitutions
- Basic cooking questions

Be encouraging and make cooking accessible for everyone.
```

**User-Facing Presentation**: Appears as a mystical cooking companion that provides wisdom and guidance, not as an AI chatbot.

**Authentication**: Requires authenticated users (AWS Cognito user pools)

**Data Handling**:

- Conversations are user-scoped and private
- No conversation data is shared between users
- Messages are processed through AWS Amplify's secure infrastructure

### 2. Recipe Generation Engine

**Role**: Generates new recipes based on user preferences and constraints

**Technology**: Amazon Nova Pro (integrated with SousChef conversation model)

**Integration Points**:

- **Component**: `/src/components/RecipeGenerator.tsx`
- **Backend**: Leverages the same conversation model as SousChef
- **Data Model**: `/amplify/data/resource.ts` (Recipe model for storage)

**Capabilities**:

- Creates new recipes from ingredient lists
- Adapts existing recipes for dietary restrictions
- Generates seasonal recipe suggestions
- Creates recipes based on available ingredients

**User-Facing Presentation**: Presented as "alchemical transformations" or "mystical recipe creation"

**Data Storage**: Generated recipes can be saved to user's personal "Grimoire" (cookbook)

## Development AI Agents

### 3. GitHub Copilot

**Role**: AI-powered code completion and generation assistance for developers

**Integration Points**: IDE/editor extensions during development

**Scope**: Code suggestions, completion, and refactoring assistance

**Guidelines**: Follows the conventions outlined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**User Impact**: None (development-only tool)

### 4. Automated Code Review

**Role**: Assists with code quality and consistency checking

**Technology**: GitHub Actions with AI-powered analysis

**Integration Points**:

- **Workflow**: `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc` configuration
- **CI/CD**: Runs during pull request validation

**Capabilities**:

- Code style enforcement
- TypeScript type checking
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance optimization suggestions

**User Impact**: None (development-only tool)

## Planned AI Integrations

### 5. Smart Recipe Recommendations (Future)

**Role**: Personalized recipe discovery based on user behavior and preferences

**Technology**: TBD (likely ML model for recommendation systems)

**Integration Points**: To be integrated with user's recipe history and preferences

**User-Facing Presentation**: Will appear as "mystical suggestions" or "fortune telling" for recipes

### 6. Nutritional Analysis Agent (Future)

**Role**: Automated nutritional information calculation and dietary guidance

**Technology**: TBD (integration with nutritional databases)

**Integration Points**: Recipe model enhancement for nutritional data

**User-Facing Presentation**: "Herbal wisdom" and "potion analysis" for nutritional content

## AI Integration Principles

### Invisible Integration

- AI capabilities are never explicitly mentioned in user-facing content
- Features are presented using mystical/magical terminology
- Users interact with "mystical assistants" rather than "AI chatbots"
- Technology details are abstracted behind thematic interfaces

### Privacy and Security

- All AI interactions require user authentication
- Conversation data is user-scoped and private
- No cross-user data sharing
- AWS security best practices are followed
- User data is not used for model training without explicit consent

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Default responses that maintain the mystical theme
- Clear error messages that don't expose technical details
- Fallback to static content when dynamic generation fails

### Performance Considerations

- AI interactions are asynchronous with proper loading states
- Conversation history is managed efficiently
- Responses are cached when appropriate
- Service timeouts are handled gracefully

## Monitoring and Observability

### Conversation Analytics

- Track conversation completion rates
- Monitor AI response quality through user feedback
- Log error rates and service availability
- Measure user engagement with AI features

### Performance Metrics

- Response time monitoring for AI services
- Error rate tracking for AWS Bedrock integration
- User satisfaction measurement through implicit feedback
- Cost monitoring for AI service usage

### Debug Information

- Comprehensive logging for AI interactions (development environment)
- Error tracking for failed AI requests
- Performance profiling for conversation flows
- Integration testing for AI service reliability

## Maintenance and Updates

### Model Updates

- System prompts are versioned and controlled through code
- Model parameter changes are tested before deployment
- Rollback procedures for AI service issues
- A/B testing framework for prompt optimization

### Integration Maintenance

- Regular testing of AI service connections
- Monitoring for AWS service updates and breaking changes
- Security patches and vulnerability updates
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New AI Features

1. Define the user-facing presentation (mystical theme)
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
4. Include monitoring and logging
5. Test with various user scenarios
6. Document the integration in this file

### Testing AI Integrations

- Mock AI services in unit tests
- Integration tests with actual AI services (staging environment)
- Load testing for conversation flows
- Error scenario testing (service failures, timeouts)
- User acceptance testing for AI feature usability

### Security Considerations

- Never expose API keys or credentials in frontend code
- Validate all user inputs before sending to AI services
- Implement rate limiting for AI requests
- Monitor for abuse or unusual usage patterns
- Follow AWS security best practices for Bedrock integration

**Note for Maintainers**: This document should be updated whenever new AI integrations are added or existing ones are modified. All AI features should maintain the principle of invisible integration while providing genuine value to the cooking experience.
